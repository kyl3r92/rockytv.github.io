title: Piwik tracking, at last
---
I took the rest of the night today to take care of my blog. Since my old WordPress blog hosted in Germany wasn't being used anymore, I decided to completely abandon it and migrate the blog posts to here.

I was thinking of migrating the blog posts, and changing the Google Analytics tracking to Piwik for quite some time already. The only problem was that I never had real desire to do it, it was just a thought. But as the server I was using is now being used to host [SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info) (a KerbalStuff replacement), I decided it was time to move away from it, and so I did it.

The real reason for the move, however, is that I wanted to keep things in the same place. I began using this blog a few months after I created the WordPress blog, and I abandoned it somehow. I don't know, Jekyll seems more appropriate for a developer than WordPress.

Lastly, I changed the tracking platform to Piwik. I don't know if it will work flawlessly, seeing that I also bought a domain name for me (you may have noticed it already).

Anyways, let's see if the move to Piwik will work flawlessly. Let's hope it does.
