There are rumors about Dilma Rousseff renouncing as president, and calling out for new presidential elections, possibly leading to the aggravation of Brazil's current crisis.

Shortly before deciding to write this post, I received some audio files that were recorded by a supposed Counselor from Alvorada's Palace. The counselor claimed that Dilma Rousseff is renouncing before the Senate decides whether her impeachment process should be open, because she wants the benefits of being a former president. While I couldn't verify the veracity of these files, I believe Dilma should accept her fate and be impeached (or not), and do something good for the country.

It's not difficult to believe that Dilma is considering renouncing, and calling new elections. In reality, she supports new presidential elections, as she already [said to the Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazilian-public-favors-new-presidential-election-1460308555):

> I will fight until direct elections are realized if I am put away, an hypothetical situation that I don't believe. I believe it is unconfortable to put away an innocent person. I am a victim of conspiration.

New elections may not be possible due to Michel Temer, the vice-president, organizing his government. There are only two ways new elections are held: either both the President and Vice-President of the Republic leave before the end of their current term, or by sending a Proposal of Constitutional Amendment (PEC) to allow new elections to be realized at a predefined date. 

If the Senate decides to open the impeachment process against Dilma, Temer will put the new government in place, and hopefully the Brazilian crisis can be reduced. Temer's Minister of Finance, Henrique Meirelles, was the president of Brazil's Central Bank during Lula's term. 

He began when Brazil was in crisis, **with the inflation and interest rates at 12.5% per year and 18.5%, respectively.** Due to his management, he achieved the longest growth in the country's recent story - 3% per year for more than 5 years - according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

During Dilma's second term, in 2015, Meirelles was indicated to be the new Minister of Finance.

If there are new presidential elections, Lula has a good chance of becoming president, [as these reports by Datafolha (Pesquisa Datafolha) reveal.](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2016/04/1759342-lula-e-marina-lideram-corrida-para-2018-tucanos-despencam.shtml). If Lula became president, Meirelles wouldn't be indicated as Minister of Finance. And the crisis would be aggravated because we wouldn't have a competent person as Minister of Finance to fix the economy, and because we would have as president someone willing to take drastic measures to prove his honesty.

[In January, Lula claimed to a group of bloggers that there's no living soul more honest than him](http://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/fausto-macedo/nao-tem-uma-viva-alma-mais-honesta-do-que-eu-afirma-lula/):

> If there's anything that I am proud of in this country, it is that there is no living soul more honest than me. Not inside the Federal Police, not inside the Public Ministry, not inside the Catholic Church, not inside the Evangelic Church. There may be equal, but I doubt it.

Curiously, [Lula is being investigated by the Public Ministry of SÃ£o Paulo (MPF-SP) for money laundering and misrepresentation](http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2016/03/mp-sp-entrega-denuncia-contra-lula.html). He is being investigated for receiving a triplex located in a condo, and for reforming one of his other properties. Both these properties were used to launder money from Bancoop and OAS. Lula was also designated Chief of Staff by Dilma Rousseff, in an attmept to obstruct investigations against him, as she tried to speed the process for the former president to become the Chief of Staff.

Summing up, if Dilma renounced, as Datafolha's reports show, Lula has a big chance of being elected as the new president and, Michel Temer's future Minister of Finance, Henrique Meirelles, would not admit his office in Lula's government, seeing that he was indicated by Lula in Dilma's second term and he did not accept the indication. Both events would lead to an aggravation of the current crisis Brazil lives.
