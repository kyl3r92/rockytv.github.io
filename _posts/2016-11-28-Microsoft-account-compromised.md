title: My Microsoft account was compromised and I can't restore my emails
---

A few weeks ago, my Xbox Live email account was compromised and Microsoft sent me an email informing me about the incident. I wasn't home at the time I was notified, so I tried recovering my account. I was surprised that I wasn't able to recover it with the information I had provided.

Assuming I had lost the account (and that I had nothing important in it), I gave up trying to recover the account until the following week, when I was finally able to change my password and regain control of it (again, assuming the person still had access to my account until then). 

When I finally logged in, I noticed something unusual: all of my emails were missing. I realized that the person had deleted them, so I finally found them under **Deleted Items**. Fighting my way through the shitty web interface of Outlook, I gave up and decided to contact Microsoft support to try and get them to restore all of my deleted emails. No success.

Before I joined a live chat with one of their customer support employees, I spent 10 minutes searching for how to actually contact Microsoft and not use their "FAQ database". Finding the page to contact them through a live chat, I was finally able to talk to Microsoft about the issue and ask for help in restoring my emails.

I described the issue I had (which was something in the lines of "your web interface is so shit you can't restore 2,000+ emails with the click of a button") and their employee replied and walked me through a workaround to restore many emails at the same time: using the famous _Shift + Click_ shortcut.

Now, here comes the fun part: still in chat with the employee, I restored some of the emails to check if their content would be restored. **Unfortunately, the content wasn't restored** and the worse part is that the same employee said this is "expected behavior". So, I just learned that when someone hacks into your account and deletes all your email, you can't have their original content back but you _can have their listing in that shitty list view_ back. Just what I was looking for!

Unable to solve my problem, I simply gave up on trying to restore the lost emails. I kept thinking how dumb they are to allow you to restore your emails without subject or content, which would be the same as not being able to restore any email. Until I found out that _Murphy's Law_ had been applied to Outlook.

I logged in my other email accounts and had to convert them to the new "Outlook Inbox". Doing so, I realized I had lost all of the saved emails I had, except that this time they wouldn't show up anywhere: not even in the **Deleted Items** folder! Well done, Microsoft!

And before someone asks how I was hacked, it's simple: remembering too many email accounts with different usernames sometimes can be hard; securing them is worse than remembering.
