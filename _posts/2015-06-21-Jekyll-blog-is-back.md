title: Jekyll blog is back
---

After a while, I've decided to revive my dead Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub pages.

This does not mean that I'm abandoning [my other blog](http://rockytv.d-mp.org). This blog will be used mainly for devblogs, and *I hope* that it will not contain any other type of posts in here. Just devblogs.

And the other blog is being used for other stuff. Like, oppinions about something, reviews, etc.
