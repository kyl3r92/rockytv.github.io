title: Starting the year off on the right foot
---
I've finished the year with a lot of enhancements for my blog, but just couldn't find will to commit time to it. So, why not leave the changes for the new year, to start the year off on the right foot?

This is just going to be a detailed changelog of the changes I made in the blog since the last commit, which was in November 5th.

- Updated README to include Octicons attribution
- Organized `<meta>` tags on `base.html` file
- Updated inline code style: now the fontsize is 85% the size of the font, and background color is lighter
- Included RSS icon on the logo, which will only show for big screens
- Removed contact page due to spam

I think this is all that I have changed in the blog for now. If I forgot something, I'll update the post.
