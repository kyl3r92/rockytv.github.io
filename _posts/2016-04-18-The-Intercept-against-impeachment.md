title: The Intercept is another brick in the wall against the impeachment

I'd like to first apologize for discussing politics in my blog. I really held myself today, but the fallacies I read were so disgusting that I couldn't hold myself anymore.

Today, I came across an article, published on [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com) which reveals their impartiality and veracity are just as inexistent as the so-claimed *coup d'état* in Brazil.

The article in question is this one, called [After Vote to Remove Brazil's President, Key Opposition Figure Holds Meetings in Washington](https://theintercept.com/2016/04/18/after-vote-to-remove-brazils-president-key-opposition-figure-holds-meetings-in-washington/), written by **Glenn Greenwald**, **Andrew Fishman** and **David Miranda**.

In the article, the authors proved that their impartiality does not exist when **they criticized President Dilma's opposition, without showing facts about Dilma's allies**. They also claim that the **impeachment is the opposition's personal *vendetta* against the unexpected results from the 2014 presidential elections**, when President Dilma was reelected, and that the impeachment is against the corruption in her government.

> Politicians and parties that have spent two decades trying, and failing, to defeat PT in democratic elections triumphantly marched forward to effectively overturn the 2014 vote by removing Dilma on grounds that, as [today’s *New York Times* report makes clear](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-vote.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news), are, at best, dubious in the extreme. Even *The Economist*, which has long despised the PT and its anti-poverty programs and wants Dilma to resign, [has argued](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/720931009999597568) that “in the absence of proof of criminality, impeachment is unwarranted” and “looks like a pretext for ousting an unpopular president.”

> Of the 594 members of the House, [as the *Globe and Mail* reported yesterday](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/721659892965253120), “318 [members of the House] are under investigation or face charges” while their target, President Rousseff, “herself faces no allegation of financial impropriety.”

As a brazilian citizen, I must say that **these allegations are incorrect**, and have no ground. The Intercept seems to be getting their arguments' foundation from members of the political party Partido dos Trabalhadores, because such allegations do not exist.

First of all, **the impeachment is not against the corruption** on President Dilma's government. According to [this article published by EL PAÍS](http://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/03/31/politica/1459453388_280149.html), Jovair Arantes, federal deputy from Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro of Goiânia, considered that there are evidences that Dilma, in fact, committed responsibility crimes, which eventually led to her process being voted on the House. 

The deputy says that there are two facts that prove that Dilma's impeachment is totally legal: emission, by herself, of six supplementary credit decrees in 2015, and irregular credit operations in the same year. Facts that, according to the deputy, are against the **[Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal de 2000](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/LCP/Lcp101.htm)** (Law of Fiscal Responsibility), which is also a part of the law that regulates the impeachment process. I quote a part of this law:

> It's a responsibility crime to attempt against the budget law and against "the keeping and legal usage of public money".

He also claims that **Dilma took a loan with a federal bank, which is forbidden by the law**.

Listing the facts above, one can clearly see that the impeachment is not the **personal *vendetta*** of the opposition as The Intercept claims to be. And that the process does not mention anything at all about corruption in her government. And, the **[Chapter VI of Law No. 1079, 1950](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L1079.htm)**, specifically states that responsibility crimes are, but not limited to:

> [...]
> 
> 10) raise funds by way of tax or contribution of revenue anticipation whose taxable event has not yet occurred; [(Included by Law No. 10.028, 2000)](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L10028.htm#art3)
>
> 11) order or authorize the allocation of funds from the issuance of bonds for purpose other than the law that authorized; [(Included by Law No. 10.028, 2000)](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L10028.htm#art3)
>
> [...]

According to the items I've quoted above from the Brazilian Federal Constitution, Dilma Rousseff's impeachment **is considered legal**.

The Intercept **also alleged that most of the members of the opposition are facing charges for money laundering, participation in the Petrobras' corruption scheme, among other reasons.**

I must say that, **although these allegations are correct** (it's nothing new for Brazilians who are up-to-date with Operação Lava Jato, the operation investigating the corruption scheme), The Intercept failed to achieve impartiality when **the authors of the article mentioned in the beginning of this claim that the impeachment is an 'anti-democratic movement'**, and it is an attempt of *vendetta* by the opposition for the unexpected result in the 2014 presidential elections.

In accordance with [this list of investigated politicians in Operação Lava Jato](http://infograficos.oglobo.globo.com/brasil/politicos-lava-jato.html), **various key members of President Dilma's party**, Partido dos Trabalhadores, **are being investigated and most of them are accused of receiving illegal money for President Dilma Rousseff presidential campaign**.

In short, The Intercept failed to achieve impartiality when the organisation criticized the opposition, and stated that Dilma's impeachment is dubious, while not criticizing the other side of the table. Dilma's allies are also involved in corruption schemes, and her impeachment is not a *coup d'état* as many believe, being declared legal by **Law No. 1079, 1950**.
