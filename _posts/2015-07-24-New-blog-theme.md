title: New blog theme
---
As you may have noticed, the blog has a new face. This new theme has a Material Design look, and follows Google's guidelines on Material Design. All of this was possible due to a framework called <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize</a>.

The blog is much cleaner now, and is mobile friendly. It is so pretty that I don't even have words to describe how pretty this new theme is.

Of course, I couldn't forget someone who helped me get started with Material Design. Yes, I'm talking about you, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ConnorKirkby/">Connor</a>. Thank you very much for your help, and your CSS lessons.

There is also a new contact form that I've added, for those of you wanting to contact me. It is powered by <a href="https://getsimpleform.com">SimpleForm</a>. 

And last, but not least, there is an About page, which should contain information about me, but until now it contains placeholder text.

For those of you wondering about my Duality plugins, I've stopped developing them for a while, since I'm on vacation and I'd like to spend my time having fun with my friends. Their development might resume in a few days or weeks. But they haven't died.
