title: Plugin development on hold
category: [duality, general]
---

According to my local Tiled plugin repository, the last change happened on August 8. Quite a while, huh? Unfortunately, things will stay the same way they are right now because of an important update that is probably being released this month.

I didn't want to spoil the reason why I stopped developing the Tiled plugin in the excerpt. The reason why I stopped developing it is because Duality 2.0 is almost being released. I believe it is going to be released this month.

Since the new update brings new cool features, and breaks some other stuff, it wouldn't be smart to continue working on the plugin, then have to port all of it to Duality 2.0. [As Adam said, the bigger your project is, the harder it is to port to 2.0](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=557).

Now, speaking about the blog, the material design theme is almost a month old. It was quite simple and it looked good, but one of my friends said it looked like a "giant mobile app". For that reason, I decided to add a sidebar, to make it look more professional. And here we are, gentlemen!

Some changes were made to the social network buttons below. The Facebook and Twitter buttons now show the amount of shares/tweets the post had, when you hover your mouse on them.

Announcing some plans for the future, I think I'm going to delete my [old blog](https://rockytv.d-mp.org) (but, of course, migrate some of the blog posts in it), and just keep using this. And then I'll probably switch from Google Analytics to Piwik, if VITAS allows me to do it.
